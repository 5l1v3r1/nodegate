## Usage

![Nodegate usage](assets/images/schema-readme.png)

This plugin help you to solve the well known problem of [API management][url-wiki-api-management].
Some people are doing this by themselves, others by using complex tools or services, but even with
this kind of systems you will have to program some mechanics. **Nodegate** help you to
programmatically configure, develop and run your API gateway, in the simple way.

### Philosophy

The concept of **nodegate** is simple:

 - You declare the gateway routes,
 - Each route have a pipeline,
 - Each pipeline contain one or more modifier,
 - For each call, a data container will pass through every modifier before the response.

_And yes, there is more!_

A bunch of modifiers are bundled with this plugin.
I hope the community will soon create tons of usefull plugins around **nodegate**!

## Installation

You know the drill:

```bash
$ npm install nodegate
```

## Hello world!

Displaying "Hello world!" is a nonsense for this kind of plugin.
We gather the weather data from a plugin API: [MetaWeather](https://www.metaweather.com/).

**We will create a route allowing us to fetch the weather for any city in the world.**

Let's check the [API documentation](https://www.metaweather.com/api/) first:

The route `/api/location/search/?query=(query)` allow us to fetch metadata about a city,
containing the `woeid` attribute needed to fetch the weather of the city with the route
`/api/location/(woeid)`.

**Two API calls are needed, perfect example!**

After installing **nodegate**, let's create a file `index.js`. We will require `nodegate` and
initializing it. We will also need the aggregator modifier, let's import it also.

```js
const nodegate = require('nodegate');

const gate = nodegate();
const { aggregate } = nodegate.modifiers;
```

Now we will create our first route, `GET`, with the name of the city on the path. The route object
need three attributes: the method, the path, and the pipeline. The pipeline will then be processes
synchronously, using on each step a *container* generated from the request, and containing the
parameters and the body of the request.

```js
gate.route({
  method: 'get',
  path: '/weather/:city',
  pipeline: [
  ],
});
```

Now we have to set the pipeline of our route. The process is simple: we need to fetch the `woeid`
from the first route of the API, then to fetch the weather from the second one. On this example, we
will return all the collected data by using the `aggregate` modifier two times.

```js
gate.route({
  method: 'get',
  path: '/weather/:city',
  pipeline: [
    aggregate('get', 'https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/search/?query={params.city}', 'search'),
    aggregate('get', 'https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/{body.search.0.woeid}'),
  ],
});
```

**Note that all the data contained on the container are accessible on the urls.**

We finally just have to listen a port:

```js
gate.listen(8080);
```

And to start our server by using your terminal:

```bash
$ node index.js
```

**That's it!** Open your brower and try it out by typing on the url:
http://localhost:8080/weather/paris

You should have a JSON with all the data we wanted!

## API

The API of **nodegate** is really simple to handle. The plugin is a function returning the gateway,
the routes are simple objects, pipelines are arrays and modifier pure functions.

Everything is detailled bellow:

  - [nodegate()](#nodegate)
  - [Gateway](#gateway)
  - [Routes](#routes)
  - [Container](#container)
  - [Pipelines](#pipelines)
  - [Modifiers](#modifiers-1)

### nodegate()

The plugin by itself is a javascript function returning the gateway.

```js
const nodegate = require('nodegate');
const gateway = nodegate();
```

#### Properties

##### modifiers

This object contains all the built-in modifiers shipped with nodegate.

```js
const nodegate = require('nodegate');
const { aggregate } = nodegate.modifiers;
// or
const aggregate = nodegate.modifiers.aggregate;
```

#### Methods

##### configure([options])

Set the global configuration for **nodegate**, but also for Express and Request.

```js
const nodegate = require('nodegate');

nodegate.configure({
  useCors: false,
});
```

If `configure` is called without `options`, the configuration will be reseted.

_Configuration properties_

| Property          | Type      | Description                                                   | Default |
| :---------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :------ |
| `express`         | `object`  | An object containing the express configuration.               |         |
| `express.useCors` | `boolean` | Express will use the CORS middleware with the default values. | `true`  |

### Gateway

The `gateway` is by convention, the resulting object when calling the top level `nodegate()`
function. It contains the methods you need to configure and start your gateway.

```js
const nodegate = require('nodegate');
const gateway = nodegate();

gateway.route({
  method: 'get',
  path: '/gateway-route',
  pipeline: [...],
});

gateway.listen(8080);
```

#### Methods

##### route(route)

Add one or more route to the gateway.

```js
gateway.route({
  method: 'get',
  path: '/gateway-route',
  pipeline: [...],
});
```

_Arguments_

| Argument | Type                   | Description                                     |
| :------- | :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| `route`  | `object` or `[object]` | Route or array of routes to add to the gateway. |

### Routes

Routes are object defining the behavior of nodegate for a specific path and method.

_Properties_

| Argument   | Type     | Description                                                                             |
| :--------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `method`   | `string` | Method of the route (`get`, `post`, `patch`, â€¦).                                        |
| `path`     | `string` | Path of the route, the path can be written on the Express way, for example: `/user/:id` |
| `pipeline` | `array`  | List of the modifiers to apply to the container.                                        |

### Container

For each http call, nodegate will start to execute a pipeline of different modifiers. This container
will be used for each request done by nodegate and for the response of the route.

The container contains the headers, body, parameters and query. By default everything is extracted
from the request except for the headers.

For example this request:

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://localhost/users \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"firstname":"Shudrum"}'
```

Will initialize the container to:

```json
{
  "headers": {},
  "body": {
    "firstname": "Shudrum"
  },
  "params": {},
  "query": {}
}
```

The principle of nodegate is to compose the container with each modifier.

**At the end of the pipeline, nodegate will, by default, answer 200 with the container body.**

### Pipelines

The pipelines are the list of modifiers to execute **synchronously** to modify the container.

Each modifier will be called with two arguments:
 - The container, with the update of the previous modifier
 - The original requests received by nodegate. (The Express request).

### Modifiers

All modifiers can be accessed from the top level function of **nodegate** or by direclty import the
modifiers path:

```js
const nodegate = require('nodegate');
const { aggregate } = nodegate;

// Or

const { aggregate } = require('nodegate/modifiers');
```

Here is the complete list of all the bundled modifiers:

 - [aggregate(method, url, [property])](#aggregatemethod-url-property)
 - [filter(properties)](#filterproperties)
 - [forwardedhost()](#forwardedhost)
 - [waitfor(method, url, test)](#waitformethod-url-test)

#### aggregate(method, url, [property])

Execute a request with the content of the container and aggregate the result to it. If `property` is
set, the result will be aggregated to the defined property name on the container.

_Arguments_

| Argument   | Type     | Description                                 |
| :--------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `method`   | `string` | Method of the request.                      |
| `url`      | `string` | URL to call.                                |
| `property` | `string` | Aggregate the result to that property name. |

_Example_

```js
const pipeline = [
  aggregate('get', 'https://api.github.com/users/shudrum'),
];
```

#### filter(properties)

Filter the container's body to keep only the properties listed on the `properties` argument array.

_Arguments_

| Argument       | Type    | Description                                  |
| :------------- | :------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| `properties`   | `array` | Array containing all the properties to keep. |

_Example_

```js
const pipeline = [
  filter(['firstname', 'lastname']),
];
```

#### forwardedhost()

Add the the container headers the property `X-Forwarded-Host` with the value of the original request
header `host`.

_Example_

```js
const pipeline = [
  forwardedhost(),
];
```

#### waitfor(method, url, test)

Execute a request until the `test` argument function returns `true`. The test function will receive
two arguments: A simplified response, and the container of the route.

_Arguments_

| Argument   | Type       | Description                                             |
| :--------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `method`   | `string`   | Method of the request.                                  |
| `url`      | `string`   | URL to call.                                            |
| `test`     | `function` | Function to execute on each request to test the result. |

_Examples_

```js
const pipeline = [
  waitfor(
    'get',
    'https://api.github.com/users/shudrum',
    response => response.statusCode === 200,
  );
];
```

```js
const pipeline = [
  waitfor(
    'get',
    'https://api.github.com/users/shudrum',
    (response, body) => response.user.firstname === body.user.firstname,
  ),
];
```

_Default configuration_

```json
{
  "delay": 300,
  "tentatives": 10,
}
```
